Optimizations

The webpage was functioning properly, but all code was wrapped in div tags making, the code hard to read.
I changed all the div tags to semantic tags, to make any issues that may appear in the future easier to find and fix.

Graders
On my original repo I cloned incorrectly, and was working out of the class repo. In my tutor session with Lawerence Kirk this week, we properly cloned the repo and went through some of the tags together. For this reason I only have one commit for all the changing of tags, as I had to start the challenge over again. In the future I will be sure to add more commits along the way.
