Horiseon Webpage

This is a all in one webpage to help your small buisness grow faster.

Optimizations

The webpage was functioning properly, but all code was wrapped in div tags making the code hard to read.
I changed all the div tags to semantic tags to make any issues that may appear in the future easier to find and fix.
